## Introduction to SQL
SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

## SQL Syntax
SQL follows a standard syntax for executing queries. Understanding SQL syntax is essential for writing efficient and effective database queries.

## Basic Queries
Basic SQL queries involve retrieving data from a single table, filtering, sorting, and manipulating data. This section covers the foundational aspects of querying data in SQL.

## Joins
Joins in SQL are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Understanding different types of joins and when to use them is crucial for querying data from multiple tables.

## Aggregation Functions
Aggregation functions in SQL are used to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. Common aggregation functions include SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, and MAX.

## Subqueries
A subquery, also known as a nested query or inner query, is a query nested within another SQL query. Subqueries are powerful tools for combining data from multiple tables and performing complex operations.

## Views
A view in SQL is a virtual table based on the result set of a SELECT statement. Views simplify complex queries by abstracting the underlying data model and providing a convenient way to access frequently used data subsets.

## Stored Procedures
Stored procedures in SQL are precompiled sets of one or more SQL statements stored in the database catalog. They offer a way to modularize and reuse SQL code, enhancing database security, and performance.

## Indexing
Indexing in SQL is a technique used to improve the performance of database queries by reducing the time required to retrieve data from tables.

## Transactions
A transaction in SQL is a sequence of one or more SQL operations treated as a single logical unit of work. Transactions ensure the integrity and consistency of data in a database by either committing or rolling back changes as a group.
